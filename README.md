# Photolabs

PhotoLabs is an engaging photo browsing application that allows users to explore a diverse collection of images across various categories. With its user-friendly interface, PhotoLabs offers the following key features:

* **Browse by Topic**: Users can seamlessly navigate through different photo categories such as People, Nature, Travel, Animals, and Fashion. This feature enables users to quickly find images that match their interests or search for specific themes.

* **Like Photos**: An interactive experience where users can express their appreciation for images. Each photo comes with a heart icon; a simple click on this icon will 'like' the photo, allowing users to engage with the content meaningfully.

* **Photo Preview**: PhotoLabs provides a preview option where users can view a larger version of the image along with more details. This allows for an in-depth look at the photos that capture their attention.
